# ︻╦╤─  EDA on Global Terrorism  ─╦╤︻

Terrorism is a complex political and social phenomenon. Terrorist attacks have a significant threat to the safety and security of the international community and have become one of the greatest obstacles to the sustainable development of global social security. According to statistics from the Global Terrorism Database (GTD), more than 200,000 terrorist attacks have been recorded from 1970 till 2017. Terrorist attacks typically involve high lethality and destructive power and directly cause massive casualties and property losses. In addition, they bring tremendous psychological pressure on people. In summary, terrorist attacks result in social unrest to a certain extent, obstructing the regular order of work and life and thus greatly hindering economic development.

Terrorist attacks pose a great threat to global security, and their analysis is imperative. Considering the high frequency of terrorist attacks and the inherent difficulty in finding related terrorist organizations, we propose a classification framework based on ensemble learning for classifying terrorist organizations. Based on a quantitative statistical analysis of terrorist organization activities in Global Terrorist Dataset (GTD) from 1970 to 2017, we have created a Exploratory Data Analysis using Python, Numpy, Pandas and also have created some beautiful visualizations using Matplotlib, Seaborn & Plotly.

**Problem Statement & Business Objective**

**Data Cleaning and Preparation:** The dataset will undergo a thorough cleaning process, ensuring data integrity, handling missing values, and standardizing variables for consistent analysis. Relevant features will be selected, and any redundant or irrelevant data will be removed.

**Descriptive Analysis**: Exploratory statistical analysis techniques will be employed to summarize and describe the data. This analysis will provide an overview of global terrorism trends over time, identifying countries and regions with the highest number of incidents, and exploring the distribution of attack types, targets, and casualties.

**Temporal and Spatial Analysis:** The project will investigate the temporal patterns of terrorist activities, aiming to identify any recurring trends, seasonal variations, or specific time periods associated with increased or decreased incidents. Additionally, spatial analysis techniques will be utilized to visualize terrorism hotspots across different regions and identify areas of high risk.

**Group Analysis:** The project will explore various aspects related to terrorist groups involved in these incidents. This will include analyzing the affiliations, ideologies, and characteristics of different terrorist organizations, examining their influence on attack patterns and understanding the evolution of these groups over time.

**Correlation and Feature Analysis:** The project will explore potential correlations between terrorism incidents and socioeconomic indicators, such as GDP, population density, education levels, and political instability. This analysis aims to identify any underlying factors or indicators that may contribute to the occurrence of terrorist activities.

**Visualization:** Throughout the project, data visualization techniques, including charts, graphs, maps, and interactive dashboards, will be employed to present the findings effectively. These visualizations will aid in conveying complex information in a clear and concise manner.

**Collaborative Platform:** GitHub will serve as a collaborative platform for individuals passionate about combating terrorism. It will encourage discussions, sharing of ideas, and collaborative analysis, fostering a vibrant community of researchers, analysts, and experts working together to enhance our understanding of global terrorism.
